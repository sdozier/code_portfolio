As a recent graduate, I don't have too many examples of my work. These are just a few solutions to Project Euler and the like so potential employers can get some idea of my coding style.

Python: a handful of Project Euler solutions. There are commands named by problem number (like prob52()) if you care to run them on your own machine. They require helperMethods.py and p067_triangle.txt

PHP: See .php files in the QuiNote project (https://github.com/Quinote/QuiNote-Final). Most are in the folder "trylogin".

jQuery and AngularJS: examples of code used within an enterprise web application are available. My employer requested I limit public access, but I may share it on request. (By the way, I wrote much of the python and SQL those APIs call too! :) )
