As a recent graduate, I don't have too many examples of my work. These are just a few solutions to Project Euler and the like so potential employers can get at least some idea of my coding style.

For PHP examples, see QuiNote project (https://github.com/Quinote/QuiNote-Final). Most are in the folder "trylogin".

Angular and jQuery examples are proprietary and may be viewed on request.
