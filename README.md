As a recent graduate, I don't have too many examples of my work. These are just a few solutions to Project Euler and the like so potential employers can get at least some idea of my coding style.

Python: a handful of Project Euler solutions. There are commands named by problem number (like prob52()) if you care to run them on your own machine. They require helperMethods.py and p067_triangle.txt

PHP: See .php files in the QuiNote project (https://github.com/Quinote/QuiNote-Final). Most are in the folder "trylogin".

Angular and jQuery examples are proprietary and may be viewed on request.
