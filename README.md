A couple simple examples to demonstrate competence in the languages I know:

PHP: See .php files in the QuiNote project (https://github.com/Quinote/QuiNote-Final). Most are in the folder "trylogin".
WordPress examples forthcoming

Java: a version of the simple game Snake I made for fun in high school (I swear, I did other things for fun in high school too). Download the compressed snake folder and run Driver.java to play, or view the files on github.

Python: a handful of Project Euler solutions. There are commands named by problem number (like prob52()) if you care to run them on your own machine. They require helperMethods.py and p067_triangle.txt. More examples forthcoming

jQuery and AngularJS: examples of code used within an enterprise web application are available. My (ex) employer requested I limit public access, but I may share it on request. By the way, I wrote much of the underlying python and SQL those APIs call :)

LISP, SQL, HTML5/CSS3, and bash examples forthcoming
